# synchrony
Synchrony is a different kind of music creation tool.

## Planned features:
* Build tracks as a series of groups.
  * Groups contain tracks, which contain either audio or midi regions.
  * Groups contain their own tempo and time signature (or not!), as well as group effects and mixing controls.
  * Groups can be overlayed to do things from simply organizing your tracks, to creating complex polyrhythmic or aleatoric music.
* Powerful plugins.
    * Use all of your favorite VST3 instruments and effects in a snap. Or, use the inbuilt FX to build powerful sonic soundscapes quickly!
* Smooth as Butter
    * A carefully crafted UI and workflow let you stay in The Zone, and a Rust backend makes sure your largest projects don't slow down your computer either!
